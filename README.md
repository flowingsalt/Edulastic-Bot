made by flowings

how to install

1. make bookmark
2. copy contents of bookmark.js
3. edit bookmark and change url to contents of bookmark.js u copied
4. go to edulastic assignment and click bookmark
5. now when u click autoanswer it does it on server side and also sets user time above 60 seconds

this may not work for all questions or teacher made assignments or short responses. there are alot of question types and i made this based from 3 assignments
this is licensed under gnu probably wont be updated too much besides if edulastic patches.
